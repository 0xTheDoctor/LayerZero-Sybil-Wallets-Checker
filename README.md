# LayerZero Sybil Checker
The LayerZero Sybil Checker is a simple web application designed to help users verify if a given wallet address is present in a list of known addresses associated with Sybil accounts. Sybil accounts are a form of online identity fraud where a single entity creates multiple accounts to manipulate a system.

Features:
Address Verification: Users can input a wallet address and check if it matches any address in the provided list.
Easy to Use: The interface is straightforward, allowing users to quickly verify addresses with just a few clicks.
Responsive Design: The website is optimized for various screen sizes, making it accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

How to Use:
Enter the wallet address you want to check in the provided input field.
Click the "Check for Sybil" button.
The system will indicate whether the address is found in the list or not.

Technologies Used:
HTML/CSS: Frontend development for user interface design and styling.
JavaScript: Backend functionality for address verification and user interaction.
Fetch API: Used to load the list of wallet addresses from an external file asynchronously.
Flexbox: Used for layout and alignment of elements within the webpage.
